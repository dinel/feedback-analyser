                   conflict, humiliation, negligence or betrayal. If anger 
                   is active, the individual attacks the target, verbally or 
                   physically. If anger is passive, the person silently sulks 
                   and feels tension and hostility. Values over 0.75 are more
                   likely to be perceived as angry.">
